# Mice_Disease_Classification

Experiments on mice tested a Downâ€™s syndrome treatment. Mice were grouped by genotype, treatment, and behavior. Readings for 77 proteins were recorded, with unreliable ones discarded. Our task is to develop a preprocessing pipeline, a classifier, and identify key proteins for classification.
